It is said that song composers of the past\r\n                used dummy texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the melody.\r\n                Dummy texts have been in use by typesetters since the 16th century.\r\n            </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"justify-content-center\" id=\"tutorial\">\r\n                <i className=\"fa fa-music\"></i>\r\n                <h1>Documentation</h1>\r\n                <h2 className=\"my-4\">All genuine Documentation at one place</h2>\r\n                <p className=\"my-4\">\r\n                    Being Geeky helps the viewer to find all the required documentation\r\n                    at one place so that they need not waste time to find offical documentation.\r\n                    The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated\r\n                    in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or\r\n                    less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real Latin words.\r\n                    This ancient dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of\r\n                    most European languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the\r\n                    relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not attract\r\n                    attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the layout.\r\n            </p>\r\n                <button className=\"btn btn-dark my-2\">Start Your Trial Now</button>\r\n                <h5 className=\"mt-2\">You can download Being Geeky from playstore or appstore</h5>\r\n                <img src={comp} style={{ height: \"50%\", width: \"80%\", borderRadius: \"10%\" }} className=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"ipad\" />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"justify-content-center\" id=\"video\">\r\n                <h1>The video lecture you shouldn't miss</h1>\r\n                <p className=\"my-4\">\r\n                With one of the best content available online.And one of the best instructors it makes Being \r\n                Geeky one of the best available learing platform available.he spread of computers and \r\n                layout programmes thus made dummy text better known. While in earlier times several lines \r\n                of the Lorem Ipsum text were repeated in the creation of dummy texts, today the full text \r\n                of Cicero's 'De finibus' serves as the basis for many dummy text or Lorem Ipsum generators. \r\n                Based on 'De finibus', these generators automatically create longer sections of the \r\n                Lorem Ipsum text or various other filler texts.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <button className=\"btn btn-primary my-4\">Start Your Trial Now</button><br></br>\r\n                <img src={lecture} style={{height: \"50%\", width: \"80%\",borderRadius:\"2%\"}} className=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"ipad\" />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"justify-content-center\" id=\"lectures\">\r\n                <h1>Lectures available anywhere anytime.</h1>\r\n                <p className=\"my-5\">You can watch the lecture anytime from anywhere and ask doubts.\r\n                The phrasal sequence of the Lorem Ipsum text is now so widespread \r\n                and commonplace that many DTP programmes can generate dummy text\r\n                using the starting sequence \"Lorem ipsum\".
